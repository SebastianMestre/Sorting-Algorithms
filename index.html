						Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Quicksort first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays. The steps are:

						<ol>
							<li> Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array. </li>
							<li> Partitioning: reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it. </li>
							<li> Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values. </li>

						</ol>

		<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p>
			These are some sorting algorithms (and related) visualizations i've made between 2017 and 2019.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of them are well-known algorithms (or are not sorting algorithms at all), there are only two original ones: the one I've named "Gapsort", and the one titled "a slightly different in-place mergesort". This last one I discovered by myself some time in 2018; soon after I found a better version of it online and ended up changing up the code somewhat, so what is shown on this repo is not quite what i discovered back then.
		</p>
		<p>
			More interestingly, I've come to know that my "gapsort" is a variation on a little-studied class of sorting algorithms known as "Library sorts", those being a variant of insertion sorts. I have not done much analysis on the run time complexity of my gapsort, but the literature sugests that a good library sort can be done in O(nlogn), and gapsort is very clearly (empirically determined) less than quadratic.
